    # OpAMP extension capabilities
    # Reference: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/opampextension/config.go
    # The OpAMP extension supports 3 configurable capabilities (all default to true):
    # - reports_effective_config: Agent reports its effective configuration
    # - reports_health: Agent reports health status
    # - reports_available_components: Agent reports available collector components
    # Note: ReportsStatus is always enabled (hardcoded in extension)
    capabilities:
      reports_effective_config: true
      reports_health: true
      reports_available_components: true
      # Note: In extension mode, the collector's OpAMP extension directly reports these capabilities
      # to the OpAMP server. Additional capabilities are handled automatically by the extension.
